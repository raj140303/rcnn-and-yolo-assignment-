    "# E= What is image segmentation, and why is it important?\n",
    "# Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments (sets of pixels) to simplify or change the representation of an image into something more meaningful and easier to analyze. It is important because it allows computers to understand the structure of images at a pixel level, enabling applications like medical diagnosis, autonomous driving, and object recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "# \u0018= Explain the difference between image classification, object detection, and image segmentation\n",
    "# Image Classification: Assigns a single label to an entire image (e.g., \"cat\" or \"dog\").\n",
    "\n",
    "# Object Detection: Identifies and localizes objects in an image using bounding boxes (e.g., \"cat\" at position x,y).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Image Segmentation: Assigns a label to each pixel, segmenting the image into regions corresponding to different objects or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7= What is Mask R-CNN, and how is it different from traditional object detection models?\n",
    "# Mask R-CNN extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch that predicts segmentation masks on each detected object, thus performing instance segmentation (object detection + pixel-level mask). Traditional detectors only provide bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6= What role does the \"RoIAlign\" layer play in Mask R-CNN?\n",
    "# RoIAlign improves the precision of feature extraction from proposals by avoiding quantization errors, resulting in better alignment of the extracted features for mask prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "# \u001d= What are semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation?\n",
    "# Semantic segmentation: Classifies each pixel by category without distinguishing instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instance segmentation: Detects individual objects and generates a mask for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Panoptic segmentation: Combines semantic and instance segmentation to provide a unified output.\n",
    "\n",
    "# \u001c= Describe the role of bounding boxes and masks in image segmentation models\n",
    "# Bounding boxes: Provide a rough location of objects.\n",

    "\n",
    "# 1= What is the purpose of data annotation in image segmentation?\n",
    "# Annotations provide labeled data (masks, bounding boxes) necessary for supervised training, enabling the model to learn what objects and boundaries look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "# := How does Detectron2 simplify model training for object detection and segmentation tasks?\n",
    "# Detectron2 provides modular, well-optimized code and pre-built models, making it easier to configure, train, and evaluate complex detection and segmentation models with less code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# \u0014= Why is transfer learning valuable in training segmentation models?\n",
    "# It uses pretrained weights to improve learning efficiency, requires less labeled data, and accelerates convergence on new tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# E\u0012= How does Mask R-CNN improve upon the Faster R-CNN model architecture?\n",
    "# Mask R-CNN adds a parallel mask branch to Faster R-CNN’s bounding box and classification branches, allowing pixel-level segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# EE= What is meant by \"from bounding box to polygon masks\" in image segmentation?\n",
    "# It means moving from coarse localization (boxes) to fine, detailed pixel-level contours (polygons) representing object shapes.\n",

    "# E\u0018= How does data augmentation benefit image segmentation model training?\n",
    "# It artificially increases dataset diversity, improving model robustness and preventing overfitting.\n",

    "# E7= Describe the architecture of Mask R-CNN, focusing on backbone, RPN, and segmentation mask head\n",
    "# Backbone: CNN (e.g., ResNet) extracts feature maps.\n",

    "# Region Proposal Network (RPN): Proposes candidate object bounding boxes.\n",

    "# E6= Explain the process of registering a custom dataset in Detectron2 for model training\n",
    "# You register your dataset by defining a function returning the dataset in Detectron2’s format (including annotations), then use DatasetCatalog.register and provide metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "# E\u001d= What challenges arise in scene understanding for image segmentation, and how can Mask R-CNN address them?\n",
    "# Challenges include occlusions, overlapping objects, and varied shapes. Mask R-CNN’s mask head and RoIAlign help segment overlapping and occluded objects precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "# E\u001c= How is the \"IoU (Intersection over Union)\" metric used in evaluating segmentation models?\n",

    "# \u0018\u0012= Explain the impact of batch size and learning rate on Mask R-CNN model training\n",
